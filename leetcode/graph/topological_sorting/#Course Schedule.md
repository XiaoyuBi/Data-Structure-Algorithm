# Topological Sort Using Kahn's Algorithm

## 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array prerequisites where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course $b_i$ first if you want to take course $a_i$.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

Example 1:

```text
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]

Output: true

Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]

Output: false

Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

## 210. Course Schedule II

(Same contexts...)

Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return __any__ of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return __an empty array__.

Example 1:

```text
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]

Output: [0,1]

Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]

Output: [0,2,1,3]

Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
```

## Solution

In a __directed acyclic graph__ (__DAG__), we can use __Kahn's algorithm__ to get the topological ordering.

Kahnâ€™s algorithm works by keeping track of the number of incoming edges into each node (indegree). It works by repeatedly visiting the nodes with an indegree of zero and deleting all the edges associated with it leading to a decrement of indegree for the nodes whose incoming edges are deleted. This process continues until no elements with zero indegree can be found.

The advantage of using Kahn's algorithm is that it also aids in the detection of graph cycles.

Solution for #207

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    indegree = [0] * numCourses
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for a, b in prerequisites:
        indegree[a] += 1
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    candidates = deque([])
    for i in range(numCourses):
        if indegree[i] == 0:
            candidates.append(i)
    
    visited = set(candidates)
    while candidates:
        cur = candidates.popleft()

        for nxt in graph[cur]:
            indegree[nxt] -= 1
            if indegree[nxt] == 0:
                candidates.append(nxt)
                visited.add(nxt)
    
    return len(visited) == numCourses
```

Solution for #210

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def findOrder(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    indegree = [0] * numCourses
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for a, b in prerequisites:
        indegree[a] += 1
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    candidates = deque([])
    for i in range(numCourses):
        if indegree[i] == 0:
            candidates.append(i)
    
    res = []
    res.extend(candidates)
    while candidates:
        cur = candidates.popleft()

        for nxt in graph[cur]:
            indegree[nxt] -= 1
            if indegree[nxt] == 0:
                candidates.append(nxt)
                res.append(nxt)
    
    return res if len(res) == numCourses else []
```
